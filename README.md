This repository contains a detailed 2019 Performance Report for Swiggy, one of India's leading food delivery platforms. The project provides a comprehensive analysis of Swiggy’s performance throughout the year, focusing on key metrics such as order trends, traffic sources, conversion rates, and operational efficiencies. The data-driven insights offered in this report were generated using Microsoft Excel, without the use of Power BI.

Project Objective

The objective of this project is to evaluate Swiggy's performance across 2019 by analyzing its order volumes, traffic data, and conversion rates, while identifying potential operational challenges. This analysis delves into key areas of Swiggy's business such as customer acquisition strategies, discount effectiveness, and payment success rates. By identifying trends and fluctuations, the report highlights opportunities for optimization, with the goal of enhancing Swiggy's overall performance.

Key Insights

The order volume analysis identified notable highs and lows in orders throughout the year. Peaks in order volumes were observed during promotional periods in January and July, while lower discounts and operational challenges, such as reduced restaurant availability, led to order declines on specific days.

The traffic analysis revealed that Facebook was the top source of traffic for Swiggy, generating over 3.7 billion sessions, followed by YouTube and Twitter. This highlights the importance of a diversified social media strategy to maximize user acquisition and engagement.

In the conversion rate analysis, multiple stages of the customer journey were examined. The L2M (Listing to Menu) conversion rate averaged between 24.5% and 26.25%, with weekends showing higher conversions. The M2C (Menu to Cart) conversion rate, measuring users adding items to their cart, ranged from 38.4% to 41.2%, with a strong influence from Facebook traffic. The C2P (Cart to Payment) conversion rate ranged between 69.35% and 72.27%, showcasing high user intent to complete purchases. Finally, the P2O (Payment to Order) conversion rate, representing successful payments leading to orders, ranged from 80.36% to 84.46%, reflecting the efficiency of Swiggy's payment systems.

Findings

Promotional campaigns and marketing activities played a significant role in driving traffic and orders. For example, a campaign in mid-January resulted in a 105.95% increase in orders. Conversely, lower average discounts and fewer operational restaurants were key factors behind order declines, such as the 55.84% decrease in February.

Discount strategies also showed a direct correlation with order volumes. Higher discounts boosted engagement, while days with reduced discounts saw significant drops in orders. For instance, days with higher discounts in April experienced a notable 92.39% increase in orders.

Additionally, the analysis identified key operational challenges. A decrease in the number of operating restaurants often resulted in order declines, while out-of-stock items and higher packaging charges were common deterrents to order completion.

Recommendations

To improve performance, Swiggy should continue leveraging promotional campaigns and optimize its discount strategies, ensuring that discounts remain attractive without impacting profitability. Improving operational efficiency by maintaining an optimal number of operating restaurants during peak periods is essential to maintaining consistent order volumes. Technical infrastructure, especially payment systems, should be continuously improved to ensure seamless transactions and reduce cart abandonment due to payment failures.

Lastly, Swiggy should focus on managing stock levels and pricing to minimize out-of-stock issues and keep delivery charges reasonable, which will help sustain high customer satisfaction and order completion rates.
